# simple calculator that finds the surface area and volume of a cylinder.
import math
print("i am a cylinder calculator. enter your radian and height in the \napporiate sections in order to find the surface area and volume of the cylinder.\n")
#in order to make my code shorter, i just combined the float function into the input function in simple terms
r = float(input("enter radian: "))
#same thing here
h = float(input("enter height of the cylinder: "))
#using (surface) area formula to solve
s_area = 2 * math.pi * pow(r,2) * h
#using volume formula to solve
volume = math.pi * pow(r,2) * h
# it would return really long numbers so i added two rounding functions.
s_area_fin = round(s_area,3)
volume_fin = round(volume, 3)
#showing the user the final rounded answers
print("surface area of a cylinder will be", s_area_fin)
print("volume of a cylinder will be", volume_fin)
