###### i imported random so the "8 ball" could randomly choose from the responses 
import random
##### i added a randomized greeting system. depending on both the person and time of the day, some of these greetings are unconventional. 

greetings = [
    "hello ",
    "hi ",
    "wassup ",
    "good morning ",
    "good evening ",
    "good afternoon ",
    "hola ",
    "hey ", 
    "bonjour ",
    "sup ",
    "wassup ",
]
print("what's your name")
username = input("type your name here: ")
print ((random.choice(greetings)) + username)

responses2 = [
    "i dont care", 
    "ok", 
    "cool", 
    "oh well", 
    ]
print("\nhow was your day?")
day = input("type here:")
print (random.choice(responses2))


print("\nanyways, i am a bad magic 8 ball. ask me a question. ")
###### i choose 40+ answers for the eight ball to answer, most which are unconventional for a eight ball to say, some are pretty normal/casual 
###### i used a variable called 'responses' to store the responses
responses = [
    "no",
    "nope",
    "no no no"
    "yea",
    "yes",
    "yessir",
    "sure",
    "duh",
    "duh",
    "not sure",
    "more than likely",
    "less than likely",
    "never",
    "hopefully not",
    "of course",
    "yup",
    "yea no",
    "no yeah for sure",
    "what???",
    "probably not",
    "probably so",
    "bad question, ask again.",
    "how would i know that",
    "your mom",
    "what do you think the answer is?",
    "ask again", 
    "ask me one more time",
    "noooo",
    "yasssss",
    "i don't understand",
    "what do you expect the answer to be",
    "lol idk",
    "idk",
    "i don't know",
    "this is common sense, you should know the answer",
    "isn't the answer obvious...",
    "systems offline",
    "who even knows the answer to that?",
    "stop asking questions",
    "if you thought of asking, it's probably 'yes'",
    "if you thought of asking, it's probably 'no'",
    
]

###### i used the while true to create a loop so the user doesn't have to 're-run' the program, the 8 ball will keep asking them
while True:
  
    question = input("ask here: ")

    print(random.choice(responses))
